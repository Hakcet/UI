            <!--Extensive Green Roofs-->
            <h3>Extensive Green Roofs</h3>
            <li>Soil Depth: Typically have a shallow soil depth of 2–15 cm.</li>
            <li>Vegetation: Usually support low-maintenance, drought-resistant plants like sedums, mosses, and grasses.</li> 
            <li>Maintenance: Require minimal maintenance, making them cost-effective and easy to install.</li>    
            <li>Weight: Lighter, generally weighing 60–150 kg/m² when saturated. </li>  
            <li>Usage: Primarily designed for environmental benefits like insulation, stormwater management, and biodiversity.</li> 
            <li>Cost: Generally less expensive to install and maintain. </li><br>

            <!--Intensive Green Roofs-->
            <h3>Intensive Green Roofs</h3>
            <li>Soil Depth: Have a deeper soil layer of 15 cm or more, allowing for a wider variety of plants. </li>
            <li>Vegetation: Can support a diverse range of plants, including shrubs, small trees, and flowers, as well as edible plants.</li>
            <li>Maintenance: Require more maintenance, including irrigation, fertilization, and regular care. </li>
            <li>Weight: Heavier, typically weighing 150–400 kg/m² when saturated. </li>
            <li>Usage: Often designed for recreational use, such as gardens, parks, or community spaces, in addition to environmental benefits. </li>
            <li>Cost: More expensive to install and maintain due to the complexity and additional infrastructure needed. </li>

            <h2>Benefits of Green Roof</h2>
            <p>According to Wallbarn Birds, butterflies, and other insects are attracted to green roofs, 
                providing a rich biodiversity that can help to bring nature back into our urban spaces. 
                The vegetation on green roofs helps to provide food and shelter for wildlife, as well as 
                providing a habitat for plants and animals. </p>
            <br>
            <li>- Rooftop gardens can support up to 30% more plant species compared to traditional urban green spaces. </li>

            <li>- Incorporating native plants can attract local wildlife, with studies showing that green roofs with native vegetation can host 50% more insect species. </li>
                
            <li>- Rooftop gardens can increase the abundance of bee species in urban areas by up to 40%, providing essential habitats and food sources. </li>
                
            <li>- Green roofs can support over 15 different butterfly species, contributing to urban pollinator networks. </li>
                
            <li>- Approximately 70% of bird species in urban areas utilize green roofs for nesting and foraging, particularly in cities with limited green space.</li> 
                
            <li>- Studies indicate that green roofs can support up to 20 bird species, enhancing urban wildlife diversity. </li>
